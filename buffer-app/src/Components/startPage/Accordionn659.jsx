            Many link in bio tools are a paid service, but you can use Buffer’s
            link in bio tool at no cost. By signing up for Start Page you can
            create your first three pages as your three channels for free. Or

            Since most social platforms don’t allow users to put links in their
            social media posts, the only place where you can put a link is in
            your social profile’s description area, which is also called the
            “bio.” When people say “link in bio” they are referring to the
            clickable link that you can find in the social media profile bio of
            Instagram, TikTok, or even Twitter. The link usually takes followers
            to a a website, a specific article, a product page, a landing page,
            or any other important URL.

            To create a free link in bio page simply go to buffer.com/start-page
            to begin building your page, if you don’t yet have a Buffer account,
            you can set one up for free. You can start adding blocks for text,
            images, videos, social links, and more, right into our editor to
            create the layout you want, or you can choose from one of our
            pre-made templates. From there, you can customize page colors and
            style as well as add your own images, GIFs, and logos. Note that if
            you’ve already have a Buffer account then building a Start Page will
            count as one of your channels. If you’ve already hit your channel
            allowance, you’ll need to upgrade your plan to publish your page.
            Once you’ve created and customized your page simply hit publish to
            claim your unique URL and start sharing it in your social profiles,
            email signatures, and marketing campaigns. For a more detailed
